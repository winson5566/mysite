<h2 id="the-collapse-of-traffic-monetization">The Collapse of Traffic Monetization<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-collapse-of-traffic-monetization">#</a></h2>
<p>Last week, Cloudflare founder and CEO Matthew Prince gave an <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-cloudflare-founder-and-ceo-matthew-prince-about-internet-history-and-pay-per-crawl/">interview</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091002.webp"></p>
<p>He put forward a new idea: <strong>the era of &ldquo;traffic is king&rdquo; on the internet is coming to an end</strong>, and AI will terminate the traditional internet business model.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091109.webp"></p>
<p>I found his explanation very comprehensive and convincing, as expected from an English and Law graduate. I have organized his points to share with everyone.</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>For the past 25 years, the internet&rsquo;s entry point has always been search. If you want something, you search for it.</p>
<p>Google dominates search.</p>
<p>For its own benefit, it has an incentive to promote the development of the internet. <strong>The more diverse and chaotic the internet is, the more advantageous it is for Google</strong>, because people will need search to deal with the messy information.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091003.webp"></p>
<p>Therefore, Google has always incentivized people to create content for the internet. Only a continuous stream of content can enhance the value of search.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In return, it provides traffic to content producers</strong> and helps producers monetize that traffic (mainly by matching content with ads).</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that Google is the world&rsquo;s largest search engine and also the world&rsquo;s largest advertiser.</p>
<p>In fact, Google has been the internet&rsquo;s biggest sponsor for the past 25 years. Without a company like Google creating a traffic incentive mechanism that allows content producers to turn traffic into money, the internet would not be the thriving place it is today.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The situation is changing now. <strong>The internet&rsquo;s entry point is shifting from a search engine to an answer engine.</strong></p>
<p>In the past, Google gave you a treasure map, and you had to visit the links yourself to find the answer. Now, large models directly give you the answer, saving the treasure map.</p>
<p>Even Google itself has a separate <a href="https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/">AI mode</a>, providing only the answer without the need to visit links.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091004.webp"></p>
<p>This is indeed convenient for users, <strong>but it fails to generate traffic, and the entire traffic-based internet model begins to collapse.</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Once there is no traffic, content producers lose their way to monetize. They can&rsquo;t make money, so they can only reduce or abandon content production.</p>
<p>The human-produced content on the internet is already shrinking, and the root cause is that the traditional &ldquo;traffic monetization&rdquo; model is no longer working.</p>
<p>There are two possibilities for the future. One is that large model companies and platform companies hire people themselves to produce content; the other is that they share a portion of their revenue with content producers in exchange for the latter providing content to them.</p>
<p>Regardless of the possibility, it means that the form of the internet we are familiar with will cease to exist.</p>

<li>A <a href="https://www.nibzard.com/berghain/">mysterious billboard</a> appeared on a street in San Francisco, showing only five numbers with no explanation.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025090702.webp"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>https:// {64659, 123310, 75584, 8138, 38271}</p></blockquote>
<p>The puzzle went viral online and achieved excellent advertising results.</p>
<p>Someone quickly cracked it. These numbers are token IDs from OpenAI&rsquo;s tokenizer. Converting them to the corresponding words gives a URL: <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/puzzle">listenlabs.ai/puzzle</a>.</p>

<li>The animated film <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-backs-ai-made-animated-feature-film-389f70b0"><em>Critterz</em></a>, supported by OpenAI, is scheduled to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May next year.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025090909.webp"></p>
<p>The film was heavily produced using AI tools. The story was conceived by an OpenAI employee and is about the adventures of a group of forest creatures after their village is attacked by strangers.</p>
<p>The production team hired artists to draw sketches, which were then input into AI models (including GPT-5) to generate the visuals (below).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025090908.webp"></p>
<p>This approach is low-cost and fast. <em>Critterz</em> is expected to cost $30 million and take 9 months to produce, both far less than traditional animated films.</p>
<p>OpenAI hopes to use this film to demonstrate the potential of AI in animated film production.</p>

<p>Such QR codes can still be scanned and also serve as great decorations. I think this is worth promoting.</p>

</ol>
<p>An Australian mining company is building an electric train that doesn&rsquo;t require (external) charging.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202506/bg2025062602.webp"></p>
<p>Their mine is located on a hilltop, and the train, loaded with heavy ore, will travel all the way down the mountain.</p>
<p>They envision that gravity will push the train downhill, and during this process, potential energy can be converted into electrical energy to charge the batteries.</p>
<p>When the train returns to flat ground and heads up the mountain again, it is empty and has little weight, so it can use the electricity generated during the descent to power itself. Theoretically, it can run long-term without external power.</p>

<li><a href="https://programmingsimplicity.substack.com/p/type-checking-is-a-symptom-not-a">Type Checking Is a Symptom, Not a Solution</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Over the past few decades, a major consensus in the software industry has been that type systems are extremely useful and crucial.</p>
<p>It is believed that type systems can find errors during the compilation phase, leading to the development of increasingly powerful type systems.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025090601.webp"></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. I believe that the type system is not the fundamental solution to complexity; instead, it creates unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p><strong>It is possible to build reliable, large, and complex systems without using a type system.</strong></p>
<p>As an example, consider complex hardware systems. Electrical engineers frequently build systems with millions of components and complex interactions. How do they ensure reliability?</p>
<p>They primarily rely on architectural principles: <strong>modularity, explicit interfaces, and strict invocation order.</strong></p>
<p>If you have a good architectural design, the type system is actually not necessary. Here are two examples.</p>
<p>(1) UNIX pipes can combine dozens of programs into complex workflows without type checking because each component adheres to a convention: what happens internally is not exposed outside the component, and external communication occurs only through explicit, simple text data.</p>
<p>(2) The internet itself does not have centralized type checking. HTTP servers, clients, email systems, and DNS resolvers interoperate through simple protocols, following the architectural principles of loosely coupled components and concise interfaces.</p>
<p>In summary, when components are truly isolated and communicate through simple, well-defined interfaces, even large systems remain understandable.</p>
<p>The future of programming lies not in better analyzing complex systems but in better building simple systems.</p>

<p>In the last issue of the Weekly, I mentioned a billboard in San Francisco that contained a riddle pointing to an AI company&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025090702.webp"></p>
<p>I initially thought this was an isolated incident, but this week I saw <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/ai/bay-area-tech-scene-dorky-now-terrifying-21042943.php">a report</a> and realized I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>San Francisco has gone crazy for AI</strong>, with AI advertisements absolutely everywhere in the city. In comparison, China&rsquo;s AI fervor is quite quiet.</p>
<p>San Francisco is geographically next to Silicon Valley, and most of the major US AI companies are located in this region. Stanford University is also nearby.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the AI concept has fueled the continuous surge of the US stock market, creating countless wealthy individuals. San Francisco is the epicenter of this frenzy, with capital and talent pouring in wildly.</p>
<p>Standing on the street, every high-rise building has an AI billboard on top.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091709.webp"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091710.webp"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091711.webp"></p>
<p>The first picture above shows a billboard that reads &ldquo;AI customer support even your mother will like.&rdquo; Is this a sign of running out of advertising slogans?</p>
<p>Driving on the freeway, the roadside is also filled with AI ads.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091707.webp"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091708.webp"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091712.webp"></p>
<p>Waiting at a bus stop, you see an AI ad that says &ldquo;Stop Hiring Humans.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091713.webp"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just AI companies doing the advertising; companies unrelated to AI are also getting in on it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091714.webp"></p>
<p>Above is an advertisement for the company Postman, an API testing tool, which shouldn&rsquo;t inherently be related to AI.</p>
<p>However, the ad reads &ldquo;Is your API ready for AI?&rdquo;, implying that you can use it for testingâthis is how they ride the hot trend.</p>
<p>These ubiquitous AI ads are not science fiction; they are the reality of San Francisco today.</p>
<p>The reason for so many ads is partly because there are genuine business opportunities, but a larger reason is that AI companies have too much money. They have attracted a continuous stream of venture capital and can also raise money from the stock market. Capital desperately needs to see results.</p>
<p>So, these companies frantically advertise. The more exposure they get, the higher their market share and company valuation become, which in turn attracts more capital.</p>
<p>This is called a <strong>bubble economy</strong>. As long as it hasn&rsquo;t burst, you blow it as hard and big as you can, and you&rsquo;ll be rewarded.</p>
<p>However, as an ordinary person, being constantly surrounded and bombarded by these ads is a bit absurd, isn&rsquo;t it? AI, as a new technology, is meant to improve work efficiency and liberate humanity, but now it has become like a religion, indoctrinating you and demanding your worship. People seem to have become its appendages, living in a world constructed by AI.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091603.webp"></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges was that if the sunflower grows too tall, the stem cannot support the flower head, requiring the use of support frames. The farmer specifically built three tiers of scaffolding.</p>

<p>San Francisco is the startup capital of the US, with countless venture capital-backed startups. Naturally, many companies also fail.</p>
<p>This has spawned a business where people specialize in acquiring the office furniture of failed companies and reselling it at a discount.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202411/bg2024111407.webp"></p>
<p>The acquired office furniture is piled up in large warehouses, and those who want it pick it out themselves.</p>
<p>Many big Silicon Valley companies, such as Pinterest, Google, and Facebook, also sell their surplus office furniture here after laying off employees.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202411/bg2024111408.webp"></p>

<p>Due to the US stock market&rsquo;s bull run in recent years, a record amount of venture capital has poured into startups, a large portion of which was spent on office furniture. As more companies fail, the supply of used office furniture is endless and cannot be fully acquired, suggesting good times ahead for the second-hand furniture business.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/6257762630958818/permalink/10080550572013319/">Australia&rsquo;s Artificial Mediterranean Sea</a></li>
</ol>
<p>140 million years ago, the Australian interior was a closed inland sea. Later, the sea dried up, and it became a desolate, arid desert.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202508/bg2025083003.webp"></p>
<p>Since the elevation of the interior is 15 meters lower than the coast, there have been historical proposals to refill the area with water and restore the inland &ldquo;Mediterranean Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202508/bg2025083004.webp"></p>
<p>However, Australia does not have that much fresh water, and evaporation in the interior exceeds rainfall, so the plan was unfeasible.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, with advancements in engineering capabilities, the plan has been resurrected, proposing the construction of a 600-kilometer pipeline to bring seawater inland.</p>
<p>Solar panels (solar energy is extremely abundant in Australia) would be laid along the pipeline&rsquo;s route to generate electricity to power the pumps, continuously pumping water into the interior.</p>
<p>In this scenario, once a lake is formed in the interior, rainfall would also increase, fundamentally changing the arid and water-scarce situation. Furthermore, a shipping industry could be established, and new coastal cities could be set up, boosting the economy and immigration potential.</p>
<p>However, many people oppose the plan. Introducing seawater would completely salinize the inland soil, making it impossible to cultivate. Additionally, the construction cost of the water pipeline is enormous, preliminarily estimated to exceed 200 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Australians are still weighing whether to pursue this crazy plan. In recent years, as global temperatures rise, the interior has become hotter and hotter, making it increasingly unsuitable for survival. Support for the idea is now rising, as spending hundreds of billions to create a sea is perhaps the only possible way to change the interior&rsquo;s climate.</p>

<p>Last month, Google released the image model Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (project name <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/models/gemini-2-5-flash-image">Nano Banana</a>).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091305.webp"></p>
<p>Google calls it the &ldquo;<strong>most advanced image generation and editing model</strong>&rdquo; currently available.</p>
<p>After trying it out, I feel it is indeed very powerful and is free to use. You can access it directly by opening the <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview">official website</a> (image below).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025092111.webp"></p>
<p>(Note: If you cannot access the official website, there are also <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aruanyf%2Fweekly+nano+banana&amp;type=issues">third-party websites</a> in the Weekly discussion area that access the official API, but most require a fee.)</p>
<p>Netizens have discovered various amazing uses for this model, and some have even compiled an <a href="https://github.com/PicoTrex/Awesome-Nano-Banana-images">Awesome repository</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025092113.webp"></p>
<p>I have selected a few very practical examples from this repository to share with everyone. It should be noted that I believe other image models can also do these things, so feel free to try them out.</p>
<h3 id="1-portrait-processing">(1) Portrait Processing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-portrait-processing">#</a></h3>
<p>The most common task for image models is certainly portrait processing. Let&rsquo;s start by uploading a casual photo.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091308.webp"></p>
<p>Then, we ask the model to convert it into a passport photo with the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>è¯·ä¸ºç§çéé¢çäººç©çæ1å¯¸è¯ä»¶ç§ï¼è¦æ±ç½åºï¼èä¸æ­£è£ï¼çç¼å¾®ç¬ã
(Please generate a 1-inch ID photo for the person in the picture, with a white background, wearing professional formal attire, and smiling with eyes open.)</p></blockquote>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091309.webp"></p>
<p>This effect is quite astonishing. It means that the person&rsquo;s expression, hairstyle, makeup, clothing, and posture can all be changed.</p>
<p>Below is an example of changing the person&rsquo;s expression, having them smile while facing the camera slightly to the side.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091319.webp"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091320.webp"></p>
<p>Changing the person&rsquo;s posture: &ldquo;å°ä¸é¢ç¬¬äºå¼ å¾ççäººç©ï¼æ¹æç¬¬ä¸å¼ å¾ççå§¿å¿ã&rdquo; (Change the posture of the person in the second image below to the posture of the person in the first image.)</p>

<p>Photo studios will be in danger going forward; portrait photos, travel photos, and group photos can all be entrusted to AI.</p>
<h3 id="2-architectural-processing">(2) Architectural Processing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-architectural-processing">#</a></h3>
<p>Another use for image models is home decoration. If you want to see interior design renderings, you can have the AI generate them. Changing the decor colors and furniture is a small case.</p>
<p>Here is a more challenging example: upload a floor plan and ask it to be turned into a 3D model rendering.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091310.webp"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091311.webp"></p>
<p>Extracting an architectural model from a photo is also quite magical.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091323.webp"></p>

<h3 id="3-packaging-design">(3) Packaging Design<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-packaging-design">#</a></h3>
<p>Next, let the model change the packaging of an item: &ldquo;å°å¾äºçæ¼«ç»å½¢è±¡ï¼è´´å°å¾ä¸çåè£çï¼çæä¸å¼ ä¸ä¸çäº§åç§&rdquo; (Affix the cartoon image from image two onto the packaging box from image one to generate a professional product photo).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091313.webp"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025091314.webp"></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025092112.webp"></p>
<p>Book covers and software boxes can be generated similarly.</p>
<h3 id="4-map-processing">(4) Map Processing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-map-processing">#</a></h3>
<p>Another major market for image models is map applications (geographic information), though a monetizable concept has yet to be conceived. Below is an innovative use case.</p>
<p>Upload a map with an arrow marking your selected location, and ask the model to &ldquo;çææ²¿ççº¢è²ç®­å¤´çå°çåºæ¯ã&rdquo; (Generate the scene seen along the red arrow.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025092114.webp"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025092115.webp"></p>
<p>It can even generate a real-life image of the scene at the red arrow from a topographic contour map.</p>

<p>An American company has launched a supersonic chef knife.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025092107.webp"></p>
<p>It has a button on the handle, and when pressed, the blade enters ultrasonic mode.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025092108.webp"></p>
<p>According to the description, when ultrasonic mode is activated, the blade vibrates more than 40,000 times per second, making the knife feel much sharper than it actually is and saving up to 50% of the effort required for cutting vegetables.</p>
<p>In some cases, placing it on food allows the waves generated by the vibration to automatically slice the food.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.beekka.com/blogimg/asset/202509/bg2025092109.webp"></p>

<li><a href="https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-70-problem-hard-truths-about">AI Coding Can Only Solve 70% of Problems</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Based on my observations, senior and junior programmers in a company use AI differently.</p>
<p><strong>Senior programmers do not fully trust AI output; they merely use AI to accelerate projects.</strong> They generally review and refactor the code generated by AI and maintain a skeptical attitude towards AI&rsquo;s architectural decisions.</p>
<p>Junior programmers are more inclined to skip review and refactoring, accepting AI&rsquo;s output wholesale, which leads to &ldquo;house of cards&rdquo; code: it looks like it works, but it collapses once put into production.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if AI will replace programmers in the future, but currently, AI coding cannot solve 100% of software problems, but it can already solve 70%. This means that <strong>AI can reduce a senior programmer&rsquo;s workload by 70%.</strong></p>
<p>The remaining 30% still requires a programmer&rsquo;s experience and expertise, and <strong>it is precisely this 30% that junior programmers lack.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, it may sound counter-intuitive: AI is more helpful to senior programmers than to junior programmers and is more likely to yield productive results.</p>
<p>Currently, AI is more like a very motivated junior programmer on a team who can write code quickly but requires constant supervision and correction. <strong>The more you know, the better you can guide it.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, the correct use of AI is for senior programmers to use it to accelerate what they already know how to do, and for junior programmers to use it to learn what should be done.</p>

<p>I think Mars can be self-sufficient within 30 years. Every two years, the planets align, and you can leave for Mars. So, there are about 10 to 15 launch windows to Mars within 30 years.</p>
<p>The tonnage of cargo shipped to Mars will increase exponentially with each departure, meaning we can make Mars self-sufficient within 30 years.</p>

<p>An AI bubble is very possible, but for a company like Meta, the greater risk is hesitation.</p>
<p>If we end up wasting hundreds of billions on AI, that would obviously be unfortunate, but I actually think the risk of missing out on AI is higher. For us, the risk is not being too aggressive, but not being aggressive enough.</p>
